## About

This repository provides a curated, evidence-grounded taxonomy of multimodal agency across digital and physical environments. It organizes end-to-end systems, enabling models and methods, evaluation resources, open infrastructure, and reusable agent skills according to their primary contribution.

> **Core criterion:** an end-to-end agent system must integrate at least two task-relevant information modalities, select grounded actions, and use observations returned by those actions or by an evolving environment to inform subsequent decisions at runtime.

Each work is assigned one canonical placement based on its primary evaluated contribution. System and benchmark branches encode exactly one primary action domain; modality, capability, temporal regime, and participant structure are recorded as independent cross-cutting descriptors rather than duplicate placements.

## 1. Foundations

### 1.1 What Counts as a Multimodal Agent

A **multimodal agent** is a goal-directed runtime system whose policy integrates two or more semantically distinct, task-relevant information modalities, selects grounded actions, and conditions later decisions on newly acquired feedback. Typical information modalities include language, images, video, speech, non-speech audio, 3D or depth, tactile or force signals, and structured sensor or application state.

The system index applies four conjunctive tests.

**1 · Multimodal evidence.** At least two independent information modalities materially affect decisions. Actions, coordinates, rewards, hidden states, and a transcript derived from the same speech signal do not create an additional modality by themselves.

**2 · Goal-directed policy.** The work exposes a decision process that selects actions toward a task objective, rather than only parsing, grounding, scoring, or generating a static output.

**3 · Grounded action.** An action changes an environment, an artifact, another participant, or the evidence state available to the agent—for example by manipulating, communicating, editing, retrieving, or invoking a tool.

**4 · Runtime feedback.** The resulting observation, execution result, verifier judgment, environmental change, or partner response causally influences a later action during evaluation.

**Robot-use agents** apply this loop to robots: a general-purpose agent invokes perception, robot-control APIs, executable programs, or learned policies as tools, then uses their consequences to decide what to do next. Robot-use is a physical action domain, not a new input modality or a synonym for every vision-language-action model.

A static multimodal model, parser, grounding module, generator, dataset, or open-loop action predictor is therefore not treated as an end-to-end agent system. Such works remain valuable and are indexed by their actual artifact type.

### 1.2 Agent Loop and Evidence

The minimal closed-loop abstraction used here is:

```text
multimodal observation O_t -> state / memory update S_t -> decision or plan P_t
        ^                                                     |
        |                                                     v
feedback O_{t+1} <- environment, tool, artifact, or partner <- action A_t
```

An entry's `Agent-loop evidence` must identify both the returned feedback and the later decision it changes. Merely executing a sequence, autoregressively predicting actions, or producing an internal chain of thought does not establish this causal feedback path.

### 1.3 Canonical Research Taxonomy

Each work receives one canonical placement according to its **primary evaluated contribution**.

**End-to-end system.** An instantiated runtime evaluated with the four-part loop above.

**Model, policy, or component.** A reusable learned artifact or subsystem whose principal contribution is architecture, representation, or prediction.

**Method.** A training, planning, orchestration, coordination, or world-model technique evaluated primarily as an algorithmic contribution.

**Benchmark, dataset, or environment.** An evaluation or data artifact, including bundled baseline agents.

**Engineering resource.** Maintained implementation infrastructure rather than a research claim.

**Agent skill.** A portable `SKILL.md` package that provides reusable procedural guidance and optional scripts, references, or assets. It is an implementation resource, not evidence of a research contribution or an end-to-end agent system.

System and benchmark branches use the same grouping variable—**primary action domain**. Modality, capability, temporal regime, and participant structure remain independent descriptors and never create duplicate placements.

Audio, video, 3D, tactile sensing, real-time behavior, and collaboration are cross-cutting properties represented in entry metadata—not competing directory levels.

Research artifacts are ordered by first public release, newest first. Each work appears once under its primary contribution type.

**How to read the entries.** The title line provides direct Paper, Project, Code, Dataset, or Collection access. The compact metadata line records the earliest inspectable release and distinguishes verified peer-reviewed venues from Preprint, Technical report, and Project release. End-to-end systems include a separate **Agent loop** line naming the returned observation that changes a later decision; it is not a generic paper summary.

**Entry display.** Every research entry begins with a bold title and ends with consistent resource badges, following the high-signal navigation pattern demonstrated by Awesome World Models: ![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-arXiv-b31b1b.svg) primary manuscript, ![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Page-2563eb.svg) official project page, ![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-GitHub-16a34a.svg?logo=github) maintained implementation, ![Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Data-f59e0b.svg) dataset, and ![Collection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Collection-List-7c3aed.svg) companion collection. The arXiv badge carries the paper identifier when available, so links remain recognizable before clicking.

### 1.4 Cross-Section Reading Paths

Use these paths to follow a capability across artifact types. A linked work retains one canonical research entry; a resource can expose both engineering code and a distinct procedural skill package.

## 3. End-to-End Agent Systems

Every entry below passes all four system tests. Systems are partitioned **once** by primary action domain. Labeled metadata preserves the independent classification axes, so a speech-enabled robot remains a physical-robot system with Speech recorded as a modality rather than being duplicated in an “audio agents” branch.

### 3.1 Information Seeking and Media Understanding

For learned visual research and tool-use policies, see [Vision-DeepResearch](#vision-deepresearch) and [DeepEyesV2](#deepeyes-v2); they remain methods rather than duplicate system entries.

The agent acts by selecting evidence, invoking analysis or retrieval tools, updating memory, and deciding what to inspect next.

### 3.6 Physical Robotics and Multi-Robot Systems

The primary action changes the physical world or coordinates physical robots. **Robot-use agents** include systems that call robot APIs, generate control programs, select semantic action units, or orchestrate learned policies, with observation and verification closing the loop. Language-conditioned policies without a separately evidenced agent loop remain in the model section.

**Robot-use reading path:**

**Reading the evidence.** Distinguish the action interface (joint commands, end-effector targets, code, or policy/skill calls), the returned observation, and the verifier. Physical trials, simulation results, and selected demonstrations provide different evidence. A simulator paused between model calls does not establish real-time control.

## 6. Benchmarks, Datasets, and Environments

Resources use the same six **primary action domains** as the end-to-end system index and are ordered in reverse chronology within each branch. Temporal properties such as streaming and participant properties such as collaboration remain metadata rather than directory levels.

**Evaluation level.** New and revised entries identify whether they test a component, a fixed artifact or replayed observation stream, an interactive trajectory, or complete task execution. These levels can coexist in one paper. State the observation mode, real application versus controlled replica or simulator, attempt/step budget, and whether the metric measures final completion, partial progress, quality, or cost before comparing scores. Dataset-only resources are not evidence of an evaluated runtime agent. Older entries should acquire this field when their protocols are reviewed.

**Cross-domain evaluation:** [WorldMemArena](#worldmemarena) covers memory across interaction domains; the [reading paths](#14-cross-section-reading-paths) connect memory, verification, and coordination without duplicating papers under several action domains.

## 7. Engineering Resources

This section contains maintained implementation infrastructure and documented interoperability protocols, grouped by engineering role. Protocol specifications are distinguished from runnable frameworks; implementations of research papers remain attached to their canonical entries unless they are distinct infrastructure artifacts.

### 7.1 Agent Runtimes and Interaction Frameworks

| TEN Framework | Real-time interaction framework | Multimodal conversational agents with RTC or WebSocket transport, VAD, turn detection, extensions, and deployable examples | [GitHub](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework) |

#### Interoperability protocols

These specifications describe communication interfaces, not complete agents or portable skill packages. An A2A Agent Card's capability descriptions are distinct from `SKILL.md` procedures.

| Resource | Type | Primary use | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Tool/resource interoperability specification | Connects agents to external tools, resources, and prompts; support depends on the client and server capabilities | [Specification, 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28) |

<a id="72-digital-agent-environments"></a>

### 7.2 Digital-Agent Infrastructure and Environments

These are reusable execution tools and environments. Research-specific resources stay attached to their papers, including [CUA-Universe](#cua-universe), [MobileWorld](#mobileworld), and [OpenCUA](#opencua). Browser, desktop, and CLI interfaces still require a caller to supply an agent policy and feedback loop.

| Resource | Type | Primary use | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 7.3 Embodied AI and Robotics Infrastructure

These resources supply robot interfaces and execution backends. A perception model, motion planner, or protocol bridge becomes part of a robot-use agent only when a caller supplies goals, decisions, and outcome feedback. Research-linked runtimes such as OpenETA, Thea, PhyAgentOS, and RPent remain attached to their paper entries in [3.6](#36-physical-robotics-and-multi-robot-systems) and [5.1](#51-tool-use-workflow-and-program-synthesis).

## 8. Multimodal Agent Skills

This section indexes reusable procedural capability packages for building, operating, or evaluating multimodal agents. Here, a **skill** means an installable directory that follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)—a required `SKILL.md` with metadata and instructions, optionally accompanied by scripts, references, or assets—or a provider-maintained compatible bundle that exposes concrete skill directories.

Static prompt collections, ordinary SDKs, model repositories, and MCP-only servers are excluded. MCP supplies live tools or data; a skill supplies reusable procedure and execution guidance. A project may provide both, but it is listed here only when an inspectable skill package exists.

Repository stars below are dynamic, repository-level discovery signals rather than skill-level quality scores or endorsements. Review each skill's license, dependencies, network and credential requirements, executable scripts, and possible side effects before installation.

### 8.1 Standards and Distribution

| Resource | Role | Why it matters | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Skills | Open specification and reference validator | Defines the portable `SKILL.md` package, metadata, progressive disclosure, optional scripts, references, and assets | [Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), [GitHub](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) |
| skills CLI and skills.sh | Cross-agent discovery and installer | Finds, installs, lists, checks, and updates GitHub-backed skills across compatible agent clients | [Directory](https://skills.sh/), [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) |
| Skills Over MCP | Working group / specification work | Explores discovering and distributing skill procedures through MCP; the charter and associated SEP are not proof of a universally supported stable client feature | [Working group](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/working-groups/skills-over-mcp) |
| OpenAI Plugins | Codex distribution catalog | Demonstrates how skills can be distributed alone or alongside MCP servers, apps, agents, commands, hooks, and assets in a plugin bundle | [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/plugins) |

### 8.2 Curated Skill Collections

Collections and focused packages are grouped by one consistent variable—**primary capability family**—while modalities and execution environments remain separate descriptors. Representative skills are examples, not an exhaustive inventory. A robot motion primitive or learned policy is not automatically a portable Agent Skill; the entries below expose concrete `SKILL.md` files.
